    <h1>A Simple Guide to Critique</h1>
    <h2>What is balanced critique?</h2>
    <p>Balanced critique is the concept of communicating as much good criticism about someones effort as bad criticsm. Too much good, and they will not be able to take future critism well. Too much bad critism, and they will not open themselves to your thoughts.</p>

    <h2>But what if I don't have anything positive to say at all?</h2>
    <p>Make something up, or just let it be. As people say, "If you don't have something nice to say, don't say it at all."</p>

    <h2>Can I please have an example?</h2>
    <p>Sure! Here's a bad example first.</p>
    <p class="example">Hey! I saw your YouTube video! It had great music. However, the pacing of the video was very inconsistent, the overall topic made no sense, and it dragged on for way too long. In addition, your monotone voice put me to sleep very quickly. I liked the ending question though!</p>
    <p>Now have a good example.</p>
    <p class="example">I saw your YouTube video! The music was good, and it ended very well. Next time though, I would aim for more consistent pacing and try for a less monotone delivery.</p>
    <p> You can see above that the bad example used the common sandwhich technique, but the "bread" doesn't hold the "meat." There are two compliments, and five criticsims. This obviously imbalanced. If we look at the second example, there are two compliments and two criticisms, which is balanced.</p>

    <h2>Any other tips you can give?</h2>
    <p>Don't use the word "you" in criticsm. This isn't about them, it's about their work. Also, if you keep practicing, you'll get better, just like everything.</p>
